# CGFD2D (MATLAB Version)

This is a MATLAB implementation of the **Collocated-grid Finite-Difference (CGFD)** method for 2D elastic wave simulation in isotropic media. The method follows the framework developed by Prof. Wei Zhang and collaborators, widely used in seismic wave modeling research.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This version does **not** implement curvilinear grids.
