# CGFD2D (Learning Version) â€” 2D Finite Difference Solver for Elastic Waves

This repository contains 2D finite-difference solvers developed for learning and research purposes. 

## ðŸ“š Purpose

The code is developed and maintained for learning and exploring numerical methods for seismic wave modeling. It includes several finite-difference schemes and serves as a simplified educational version of the CGFD3D method.

##  Main Programs

- `main_cart.m`:  
  FD in Cartesian grid
 
- `main_curv_mac.m`:  
  FD in Curvilinear grid

##  Solver

- **MacCormack Scheme (MAC)**  

- **Operator Splitting (OS)**  

- **Central Difference Scheme (CTL)**  

- **Explicit Filtering (FLT)**  

**Time Integration**:  
All solvers use **classic 4th-order Runge-Kutta**. 

**Source Term**:  
The source is added in each substage via `Add_source.m`. 


##  Usage

Run any of the main scripts in MATLAB:
```matlab
>> main_cart
>> main_curv
```
