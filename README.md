# CGFD2D (Learning Version) â€” 2D Finite Difference Solver for Elastic Waves

This repository contains 2D finite-difference solvers developed for learning and research purposes. 

## ðŸ“š Purpose

The code is developed and maintained for learning and exploring numerical methods for seismic wave modeling. It includes several finite-difference schemes and serves as a simplified educational version of the CGFD3D method.

##  Main Programs

| Script         | Description                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| `main_cart.m`  | FD modeling on a Cartesian grid     |
| `main_curv.m`  | FD modeling on a curvilinear grid   |

Run either in MATLAB:

```matlab
>> main_cart
>> main_curv
```

##  Numerical Methods

- **MacCormack Scheme (MAC)**  

- **Operator Splitting (OS)**  

- **Central Difference Scheme (CTL)**  

- **Explicit Filtering (FLT)**  

**Time Integration**:  
All solvers use **classic 4th-order Runge-Kutta**.
